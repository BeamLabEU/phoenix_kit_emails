  Ownership contract for this package's migration chain. `up_statements/1`
  and `down_statements/2` are the testable data form of what `up/1` and
  `down/1` execute, so most of this runs without a database.

  Two things it exists to pin:

    * **Nothing here can destroy data.** These tables are core-created on
      every install that exists today and hold the delivery history, so no
      statement this module can emit may contain `DROP` — the exact trap
      `phoenix_kit_legal`'s own chain documents having been one repaired
      version marker away from springing.
    * **The adopted DDL does not drift from core's.** V1 is an adoption
      step (see the module's moduledoc): every adopted statement must be
      byte-identical to what core's `ExpectedSchema` manifest declares for
      the same object, or a fresh install would end up with a shape core's
      auditor calls drifted.
