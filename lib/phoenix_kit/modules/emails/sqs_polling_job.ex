defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.SQSPollingJob do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker for polling AWS SQS queue for email events.

  This is the sole SQS poller: an Oban-based approach that allows dynamic
  enabling/disabling without an application restart (see `SQSPollingManager`).

  ## Architecture

  ```
  AWS SES → SNS Topic → SQS Queue → SQSPollingJob (Oban) → SQSProcessor → Database
  ```

  ## Multi-account cycle

  One Oban chain, N accounts polled inside each cycle — the shape
  `BrevoPollingJob` already uses, deliberately copied rather than
  generalised. An "account" here is an `aws_ses` Integrations connection
  referenced by an enabled `SendProfile` (see
  `PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.AwsIntegrations`), carrying its OWN queue URL
  and its OWN credentials — an SES account can only publish events to a
  queue it owns, so polling account A's queue with account B's keys is not
  a degraded mode, it is silence.

  Per-account pipeline settings live in `aws_tracking:<integration_uuid>`
  (see `Emails.get_aws_tracking/1`). Two paths stay alive underneath:

  - **No active `aws_ses` SendProfile at all** — the legacy single-queue
    deployment (env-var or plain-Settings credentials, no profile system).
    The global `aws_sqs_queue_url` + `get_aws_*` credentials are polled
    exactly as before.
  - **An active account with no `aws_tracking:` entry of its own** —
    inherits the global `aws_sqs_queue_url`, but only when the globals can
    be attributed to it unambiguously: it is the account
    `emails_aws_integration_uuid` selects, or it is the only active account.
    With two-plus unattributed accounts the globals describe one queue and
    nothing says whose, so those accounts are skipped (and logged) until
    the operator configures them per-account, rather than having several
    accounts race on one queue with mismatched keys.

  A misconfigured account (credentials that no longer resolve) backs the
  WHOLE cycle off to `@misconfig_backoff_ms`, matching `BrevoPollingJob` —
  a deliberate simplification: one shared cadence, no per-account state.
  An account merely missing a queue URL is not "misconfigured" in that
  sense — it is skipped at full cadence, since a half-configured second
  account must not slow event delivery for a working first one.

  ### Cycle duration with N accounts

  Accounts are polled sequentially and each long-poll waits up to
  `@default_long_poll_timeout` seconds, so a quiet cycle over N accounts
  takes about N x 20s. That does NOT put the self-scheduling chain at risk:
  this worker does not override `c:Oban.Worker.timeout/1`, and Oban's
  default is `:infinity` — there is no deadline that could kill the job
  mid-cycle and hand the chain to Oban's retry machinery. (Adding one would
  be actively harmful: a killed cycle is retried by Oban WHILE
  `schedule_next_poll/1` has already queued a successor, which is how you
  get two chains.)

  What it does cost is latency and a queue slot: `sqs_polling` is
  concurrency 1, so the next tick starts one interval after this cycle
  ENDS, not after it began. With a handful of accounts that is the
  difference between a 5s and a ~25s effective cadence — acceptable, and
  self-correcting in the sense that a busy queue returns immediately rather
  than waiting out the long-poll. If it ever stops being acceptable, the
  fix is parallelism or one chain per account (phase 2), not a timeout.

  ## Features

  - **Dynamic Configuration**: Automatically responds to settings changes without restart
  - **Oban Integration**: Uses Oban's job system for reliable background processing
  - **Self-Scheduling**: Each job schedules the next polling cycle
  - **Batch Processing**: Process up to 10 messages at a time
  - **Error Handling**: Retry logic with Dead Letter Queue
  - **Settings-Based Control**: Polling can be enabled/disabled via Settings

  ## Configuration

  All settings are retrieved from PhoenixKit Settings:

  - `sqs_polling_enabled` - enable/disable polling (checked before each cycle)
  - `sqs_polling_interval_ms` - interval between polling cycles
  - `sqs_max_messages_per_poll` - maximum messages per batch
  - `sqs_visibility_timeout` - time for message processing
  - `aws_sqs_queue_url` - SQS queue URL
  - `aws_region` - AWS region

  ## Usage

      # Enable polling (starts first job)
      PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.SQSPollingManager.enable_polling()

      # Disable polling (stops scheduling new jobs)
      PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.SQSPollingManager.disable_polling()

      # Trigger immediate polling
      PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.SQSPollingManager.poll_now()

      # Check status
      PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.SQSPollingManager.status()

  ## Oban Queue Configuration

  Add to your `config/config.exs`:

      config :your_app, Oban,
        repo: YourApp.Repo,
        queues: [
          sqs_polling: 1  # Only one concurrent polling job
        ]

  ## Implementation Notes

  - Uses Oban's own `unique:` (not a manual delete-then-insert) to keep
    exactly one future job queued — see the `unique:` option below for
    the full reasoning; it's the subtle part of this module.
  - Schedules next job only if polling is enabled
  - Uses `SQSProcessor` for event processing

  ## Why `unique: [period: :infinity, states: [:scheduled]]`, not more

  This looks under-specified at first glance — Oban's own unique-states
  groups (`:incomplete`, or the full default) include `:executing`,
  `:available`, `:retryable` too. Each of those is excluded here for a
  concrete reason, not an oversight:

  - **`:executing` must never be in this worker-level list.** The chain
    works by a currently-`:executing` job inserting its own successor
    from inside `perform/1`. Oban marks a job `:executing` in the DB
    *before* calling `perform/1`, and its unique-conflict check has no
    self-exclusion — an insert of the same worker/args while `:executing`
    is in `states` finds that job's *own* row as the "existing" match and
    no-ops against it instead of creating a new `:scheduled` row. The
    chain would silently stop advancing every single cycle, not just on
    a crash. (A job orphaned in `:executing` by a hard kill would make
    this permanent, on top of merely stalling per-cycle.)
  - **A wider list (e.g. adding `:available`) fails the build.** Oban's
    `use Oban.Worker, unique: [...]` option is checked at compile time
    (`Oban.Worker.__after_compile__/2` → `Job.warn_unique/1`): any
    `:states` list other than the exact literal `[:scheduled]` that
    doesn't cover every "incomplete" state (`:scheduled`, `:available`,
    `:executing`, `:retryable`, `:suspended`) emits a compiler warning
    ("may break uniqueness"), which `--warnings-as-errors` turns into a
    build failure. `[:scheduled]` alone is Oban's own special-cased
    exception to that check (see `Job.warn_unique/1`) — it is the *only*
    partial list that both compiles clean and excludes `:executing`.
  - `[:scheduled]` is exactly enough for THIS insert: self-scheduled jobs
    always land in `:scheduled` (interval >= 1000ms ⇒ schedule_in >= 1s,
    never `:available`), so it dedups the self-reschedule chain against
    itself with no manual delete step. `period: :infinity` (not a short
    window) makes that hold regardless of how long the configured
    interval is — a short window only caught *near-simultaneous* double
    inserts; the old delete-then-insert dance existed specifically to
    catch the case a short window couldn't (two chains a full interval
    apart). An unconditional `:infinity` unique check removes the need
    for that dance entirely.
  - The immediate job from `SQSPollingManager.enable_polling/0` /
    `poll_now/0` is a **different** insert with its own **per-call**
    `unique:`/`replace:` override (`states: [:available, :scheduled]`) —
    see `SQSPollingManager`'s `insert_poll_job/0` and
    `insert_forced_poll_job/0`. A per-call override on `new/2` does NOT
    go through the compile-time check above (only the worker-level `use`
    default does), so it's free to cover `:available` too. It still
    excludes `:executing` for the same self-conflict reason. `poll_now/0`
    additionally carries `args: %{"forced" => true}`, which puts it in a
    separate uniqueness namespace (Oban matches on args) so a manual poll
    never moves the regular chain's next tick.
  - Concurrency is capped at 1 by the queue, so parallel *execution* is
    already impossible; `unique:` is what prevents parallel *chains*.

  #     `aws_secret_access_key` Settings, env vars, or a bare `aws_ses`
  #     Integrations connection with no SendProfile pointed at it at
  #     all). Requiring a SendProfile unconditionally would silently stop
  #     polling for every one of those pre-existing setups. Checked
  #     first — it's the cached lookup (`PhoenixKit.Cache`-backed, see
  #     `Emails.aws_ses_credentials/0`), cheaper than the DB round trip
  #     below.
