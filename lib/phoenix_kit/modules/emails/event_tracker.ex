defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.EventTracker do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour every provider delivery-event tracker implements (SES, Brevo,
  future Mailgun/…). See
  `dev_docs/specs/2026-07-26-email-event-tracking-universalization-spec.md`
  §4.1 for the full design rationale.

  The lifecycle invariant every registered tracker must satisfy:

  > iff `should_run?/1` (== `eligible?/1 and enabled?/1`), exactly one
  > self-scheduling Oban chain is queued for `worker/1`; otherwise none.

  `EventTrackerReconciler` is what actually enforces this — a tracker
  only needs to answer the callbacks below honestly.

  ## `eligible?/1` vs `enabled?/1` — not the same gate

  `eligible?/1` folds every *feature/source* gate: "does a working event
  source exist for this provider at all". `enabled?/1` is *only* the
  operator's polling on/off switch. Conflating them was the SES poller's
  original bug (`SQSPollingJob.should_poll?/0` gates on three things —
  `Emails.enabled?()`, `email_ses_events`, AND `sqs_polling_enabled` — not
  two): `email_ses_events` is a feature flag ("is SES event tracking a
  thing here at all"), which belongs in `eligible?/1`, not folded into
  the polling toggle. Getting this split right is what lets the admin
  panel (P2) distinguish "Idle — no integration" (eligible? false) from
  "Off" (enabled? false) as genuinely different states.

  hasn't run yet since a `SendProfile` was just added — no PubSub for
