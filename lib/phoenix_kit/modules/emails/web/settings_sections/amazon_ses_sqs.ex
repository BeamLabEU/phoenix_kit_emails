defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.Web.SettingsSections.AmazonSesSqs do
  @moduledoc """
  The Amazon SES half of the "Delivery event tracking" panel: everything
  SES-specific behind the expanded `aws_ses` row — which Integrations
  connection supplies SES/SQS credentials, the per-account queues, one-click
  infrastructure setup, and the SQS worker's tuning knobs.

  Reached through `SQSPollingManager.settings_component/0`, not through
  `PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.email_settings_sections/0`. It used to be a
  third section on the settings page, listed as a peer of the tracker table
  while actually being the detail of one of its rows: it repeated that
  table's "is collection on" answer, and nothing on the page said which
  row it belonged to.

  Loads everything it renders in `update/2` and takes no assigns but `id`,
  which is what lets the panel render it without knowing anything about SES.
