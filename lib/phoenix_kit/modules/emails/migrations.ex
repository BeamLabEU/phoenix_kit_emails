defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.Migrations do
  @moduledoc """
  Module-owned versioned migrations for `phoenix_kit_emails` — the
  decentralized-migrations protocol core's `mix phoenix_kit.update`
  discovers via `c:PhoenixKit.Module.migration_module/0`:
  `current_version/0` + `migrated_version_runtime/1` + idempotent `up/1` +
  version-aware `down/1`. `PhoenixKit.Modules.Legal.Migrations` is the
  reference implementation this chain is shaped after — same situation, and
  V1 here is the same kind of step: an ADOPTION, not a create.

  ## Ownership history — read before touching

  Every table this chain names was created by core, back when email
  tracking still lived inside core, and today ships in core's squashed
  V135 baseline (plus later deltas — see "Where the DDL comes from"). When
  the module was extracted into this package the tables stayed in core's
  chain, exactly as `phoenix_kit_consent_logs` did for
  `phoenix_kit_legal`. So on every existing install the tables predate this
  chain and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` finds them already there.

  This chain moves ownership of their FUTURE shape here. It is deliberately
  a TRANSITIONAL duplication: right now BOTH core's baseline and this
  chain can create these tables, and the statements are written to be
  shape-identical so that it does not matter which one wins. The next step
  is a core release that stops creating them, after which this chain is
  their only creator. See
  `dev_docs/reports/2026-08-12-emails-table-adoption.md` for the full plan,
  including the excluded-object protocol core's `ExpectedSchema` manifest
  needs before that release.

  ## What V1 is

  V1 is an ADOPTION step plus exactly one shape change:

    * **Adoption.** `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `ADD COLUMN IF NOT
      EXISTS` + `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` + guarded `ADD CONSTRAINT` for
      the six tables this package owns. On an existing install every one of
      them is a no-op and the only new object is the `pke_schema:1` marker.
      On a hypothetical future install whose core baseline no longer
      creates them, the same statements create them — with core's exact
      object names, column types, widths and defaults.
    * **One genuine change:** a nullable `integration_uuid` (uuid) column
      plus its index on `phoenix_kit_email_logs`. Before it, a log recorded
      only the provider *kind* (`"aws_ses"`, `"brevo_api"`), so with
      several accounts of the same kind configured there was no way to tell
      WHICH account sent a message — which is what per-account event
      tracking needs (see `PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.AwsIntegrations`).
      Nullable because every pre-existing row genuinely has no known
      account, and because the stamp is best-effort on the send path (see
      `PhoenixKit.Modules.Emails.Interceptor`): an unstamped row must
      remain a valid row, not a constraint violation.

  Because the adoption half changes no shape, core's `ExpectedSchema`
  manifest stays accurate for it and NO core release is required. The
  `integration_uuid` column is the one declared deviation: core's audit
  reports an unknown column as an `:info`-level "extra column, not in the
  manifest" finding, never a failure — checked, and accepted.

  ## Which tables, and which one is NOT here

  Adopted: `phoenix_kit_email_logs`, `phoenix_kit_email_events`,
  `phoenix_kit_email_blocklist`, `phoenix_kit_email_templates`,
  `phoenix_kit_email_metrics`, `phoenix_kit_email_orphaned_events`.

  "Nothing outside this package READS them" is true; "nothing outside this
  package DEPENDS on them" is not, and the difference matters for the release
  that follows. Core's V135 creates
  `fk_newsletters_broadcasts_template` — `phoenix_kit_newsletters_broadcasts.template_uuid`
  referencing `phoenix_kit_email_templates(uuid)` — so a core release that
  stops creating `phoenix_kit_email_templates` breaks a FRESH install outright
  (core's chain runs before every module chain, so the FK would point at a
  table that does not exist yet), and breaks it permanently on an install that
  does not have this package at all. That FK has to move or go in the same
  release; see the "Transitional state" section of
  `dev_docs/reports/2026-08-12-emails-table-adoption.md`.

  **`phoenix_kit_email_send_profiles` is deliberately NOT adopted.** The
  send-profile system lives in CORE (`PhoenixKit.Email.SendProfile` /
  `PhoenixKit.Email.SendProfiles`) and drives `PhoenixKit.Mailer`'s send
  path with or without this package installed. This package only READS it
  (through `AwsIntegrations` / `BrevoIntegrations`). Adopting a table core
  itself depends on would be the mirror of the mistake the legal package's
  own report documents — claiming ownership of something that outlives you.

  Two of the adopted tables — `phoenix_kit_email_metrics` and
  `phoenix_kit_email_orphaned_events` — currently have no reader in this
  package (no Ecto schema, no query); they are pre-extraction leftovers.
  They are adopted anyway: nothing else in the ecosystem touches them, and
  leaving them out would strand them with no owner at all the moment core
  stops creating them.

  ## Where the DDL comes from

  Mechanically extracted from core's own `PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema`
  manifest — the same object list `mix phoenix_kit.doctor` and
  `mix phoenix_kit.repair` verify a live database against — so every
  statement is byte-identical to what core would emit for the same object,
  at the manifest's CURRENT shape (not just the V135 snapshot). It was not
  retyped from the baseline by hand, because that is precisely how the
  legal package accumulated three disagreeing DDL copies of one table.
  `test/phoenix_kit/modules/emails/migrations_test.exs` pins the
  correspondence: it compares every statement here against the live
  manifest and fails on drift, while skipping objects the manifest no
  longer declares — which is what makes it survive, rather than block, the
  core release that removes them.

  ### Where this chain deliberately differs from the manifest

  Four departures, each narrow and each pinned by name in
  `migrations_test.exs`, so the list cannot grow quietly:

    * **`CREATE TABLE` carries core's full column list** rather than the
      manifest's bare `CREATE TABLE ... ()`. The manifest's form is repair DDL
      and cannot express `NOT NULL` on a column without a default — see
      `table_statements/0`.
    * **Primary keys are probed by `contype`, not by name**, and
    * **the foreign key is added `NOT VALID`** — see `constraint_statements/0`.
      Both exist because this chain replays constraints on long-lived
      databases that core's baseline never re-runs on.
    * **`gin_trgm_ops` is unqualified.** The manifest hard-codes
      `public.gin_trgm_ops`, which is a `pg_dump`-shaped rendering of what
      core's V137 actually writes unqualified. An operator class lives in the
      schema its EXTENSION was installed into, and `pg_trgm` is not required
      to be in `public`: hard-coding the schema turns "trigram search works"
      into "the migration fails" on any install that put the extension
      elsewhere. Unqualified resolves through `search_path`, which is what
      core's own DDL relies on.

  Two dependencies stay core's: the `uuid_generate_v7()` function used in the
  `uuid` defaults, and the `pg_trgm` extension behind the `gin_trgm_ops`
  indexes. The operator class is referenced UNQUALIFIED (see the departures
  above): it lives in whatever schema `pg_trgm` was installed into, which is
  not required to be `public` and is not the install's own prefix either, so
  `search_path` — the way core's V137 writes it — is the only spelling that
  works on every install.

  Both are core infrastructure shared by every module, and core's chain
  runs before any module chain (`mix phoenix_kit.update`), so they are
  always in place first.

  ## Locking

  The `CREATE INDEX` statements are plain, not `CONCURRENTLY`: this chain runs
  inside core's generated migration, and `CONCURRENTLY` cannot run in a
  transaction (`@disable_ddl_transaction` belongs to the migration module core
  generates, not to this one — it is not ours to set).

  On the installs this matters for, the DDL itself costs nothing: every
  statement is `IF NOT EXISTS` and every object already exists, so each one is
  a catalog lookup. The LOCKS are not free, though — Postgres acquires the
  lock before it evaluates `IF NOT EXISTS`, so 96 `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
  against `phoenix_kit_email_logs` each want `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` on the busiest
  table in the module. `up_statements/1` therefore opens with
  `SET LOCAL lock_timeout` (see `lock_timeout_statement/0`): behind a
  long-running reader the migration fails in five seconds with a clear error
  instead of hanging the deploy and queueing every query on that table behind
  it. Retry during a quiet window.

  Be precise about what that costs, because the earlier version of this
  paragraph was not: `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` takes `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`, not
  `SHARE`, and it takes it even when the column already exists and the
  statement does nothing. `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` blocks READS as well as writes,
  and every lock in a transaction is held until COMMIT — so for the duration
  of V01, `phoenix_kit_email_logs` is unavailable to the application, not
  merely unwritable. On a healthy install that is milliseconds of catalog
  lookups; the number that matters is how long the whole chain takes, not any
  one statement.

  The one statement that does real WORK on an existing install is the new
  `integration_uuid` index. Expect seconds on a table of a few million rows —
  and, because it runs inside the same transaction, that is seconds with the
  table fully locked. A host that cannot afford it should create the index
  `CONCURRENTLY` by hand first (outside any transaction), after which this
  statement finds it and does nothing:

      CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS phoenix_kit_email_logs_integration_uuid_idx
        ON public.phoenix_kit_email_logs USING btree (integration_uuid);

  Run `mix phoenix_kit.doctor` before upgrading. It reports exactly the two
  conditions that make this chain's constraint statements interesting — a
  drifted `phoenix_kit_email_events` shape and orphaned `email_log_uuid`
  rows — and it is cheaper to know beforehand than to find out from a failed
  deploy.

  ## One known, harmless cosmetic difference

  Two partial indexes on `phoenix_kit_email_events` were originally written
  by core's V137 as `WHERE event_type NOT IN ('open', 'click')`, while the
  manifest carries the `pg_get_indexdef` round-trip of that predicate. Both
  spellings mean the same thing and produce the same index under the same
  name, but Postgres renders the two parse trees differently, so
  `pg_get_indexdef` output differs by parenthesisation between a
  core-CREATED and a manifest-created database. This is core's own
  behaviour — its repair path emits the manifest form too — and nothing
  checks index definitions textually (the manifest's own `check` is a
  catalog existence probe by name). Verified end to end against a real
  database: dropping all six tables and replaying `up_statements/1` yields
  IDENTICAL columns and constraints, and identical indexes apart from
  these two renderings.

  ## What `down/1` is NOT

  `down/1` unstamps the version marker; it NEVER drops a table and never
  drops a column. These tables carry the delivery history and, on every
  install that exists today, were created by core — rolling the MODULE
  back must not destroy either. Re-running `up/1` after a rollback would
  return the tables, but not the rows. The ownership test pins this by
  asserting that no statement this module can emit matches `DROP`.

  The migrated version is tracked as a `pke_schema:<N>` `COMMENT` on
  `phoenix_kit_email_logs` (the marker convention from the legal/projects
  chains, namespaced for this package). A marker-less table reads as
  version 0 — the core-baseline shape from before this chain existed.

  #
  # This is the one place the chain deliberately does NOT reproduce core's
  # manifest string, and the reason is that we are the first thing to replay
  # these constraints on databases that have been running for years. Core's own
  # baseline does not re-run on them; core's V163 exists precisely because it
  # found production databases where `phoenix_kit_email_events.uuid` was
  # `varchar` and nullable with no primary key at all, and V163 itself gives up
  # and leaves the database unrepaired past a row-count or lock threshold. So
  # "the constraint is missing, add it" is a live case, not a hypothetical, and
  # it has to be safe.
  #
  # Two departures, both narrow:
  #
  #   * **Primary keys are guarded by `contype`, not by `conname`.** A table
  #     whose primary key exists under a DIFFERENT name passes a name-based
  #     probe and then fails the ALTER with "multiple primary keys for table
  #     are not allowed", aborting the host's whole migration. What we actually
  #     need to know is "does this table have a primary key", which is exactly
  #     what `contype = 'p'` asks.
  #   * **The foreign key is added `NOT VALID`.** `phoenix_kit.doctor` ships a
  #     dedicated check for orphaned `phoenix_kit_email_events.email_log_uuid`
  #     rows, which means they exist in the wild — and validating against them
  #     aborts the migration. `NOT VALID` enforces the constraint for every new
  #     row while leaving the existing ones alone. The constraint is present
  #     and named either way, which is what core's catalog probe checks for.
  #
  #     **It will not be validated for you.** Core has no `convalidated`
  #     anywhere: its constraint snapshot reads `conname`/`contype`/the
  #     definition, `repair` answers "already present" for an object that
  #     exists, and it only validates constraints it created itself. So on a
  #     populated table this stays NOT VALID indefinitely and nothing reports
  #     it. That is a deliberate, documented end state, not a hand-off — the
  #     operator who wants it validated cleans up the orphans and runs
  #     `ALTER TABLE <schema>.phoenix_kit_email_events
  #     VALIDATE CONSTRAINT fk_email_events_email_log_uuid;` themselves. See
  #     the report's "Running this on a database that has been alive for
  #     years".
  #
  # `to_regclass/1` returns NULL rather than raising for a table that does not
  # exist, so a chain running against a database that somehow lacks one of
  # these tables skips its constraint instead of blowing up mid-transaction.
